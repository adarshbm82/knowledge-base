# Fraud Protection

<div class="info-box">General information about Fraud Protection available in this [article](/university/articles/Grow_FraudProtection).</div>

In order to turn on Fraud Protection in Unity3d, all you need to do is click on the `Fraud Protection` check box in Soomla Settings.
Optionally, you can turn on `Verify On Server Failure` if you want to get purchases automatically verified in case of
network failures during the verification process.

Additionally you need to provide specific params needed for your billing service provider.

  For Google Play go over to [Google Play Purchase Verification](/soomla/android/store/Store_GooglePlayVerification).
