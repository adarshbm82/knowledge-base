# Debugging

iOS-store provides debug messages that are printed to the log.
<br>In `StoreConfig.m` you will find:

``` objectivec
#ifdef DEBUG
BOOL STORE_DEBUG_LOG                = YES;
#else
BOOL STORE_DEBUG_LOG                = NO;
#endif
```

The debug messages are printed because the default value of `DEBUG` is 1 (can be found in your project's Build Settings).

If you don't want to see the log messages change `DEBUG` to 0.
