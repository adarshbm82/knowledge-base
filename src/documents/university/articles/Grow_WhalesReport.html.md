# Whales Report

The Whales Report is a weekly report sent to studios with games participating in the GROW network. The report will be sent to games with more than 50 weekly players on their non-testing environments. The Whales Report gives you insights about paying users' week-over-week metrics such as conversion, Avg. days to payment and more.

The data provided in the Whales Report is generated using aggregated data collected on the GROW network. Your report will show you a clear view of how your game performs with the paying users from GROW.

The whales report includes many metrics, some measured across the past week and some alltime (over all data available).

<br><br>

### Let's explain the different metrics in the report using an example:

<br>

1 - **New paying users:** players who are new to your game this week and have paid in the game. Shows also how many new paying users were in your game last week and the trend.<br>

2 - **New paying users graph:** this graph shows your historical count of new paying users going 12 weeks back. You can see how well your game's doing at acquiring new paying users week over week.<br>

</figure>
<br>
3 - **New users:** players that played your game for the first time during this week.<br>

4 - **Seen in GROW:** <u>new users</u> that were seen (have played) in the the Grow network before they played your game. These are players you could find out more about using the Insights API.<br>

5 - **Paid in GROW:** <u>new users</u> that paid before in other games in the Grow network. These are the whales that have entered your game. Focus on these paying users to get them to pay in your game as well.<br>

6 - **Paid in your game:** <u>new users</u> that have paid exclusively in your game and didn’t pay in other games in the Grow network.<br>

7 - **Missed potential sales:** this section shows your game’s conversion from the Grow network. It shows how many of the whales from Grow that played in your game didn't pay this week in your game. The missed potential sales figure comes from multiplying number of whales not paying in your game with the Weekly ARPPU (= Weekly Average Revenue Per Paying User = Weekly Revenue divided by Weekly Paying Users Count).<br>

11 - **All-time users played:** total count of users who played your game since you joined the Grow network.<br>

12 - **All-time users paid:** total count of users who paid in your game since you joined the Grow network.<br>

13 - **Average days to payment:** how many days on average (on all days since you joined Grow) does it take a paying user to start paying in your game since he started playing it.<br>
