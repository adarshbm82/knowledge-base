# Virtual Economy

## Introduction
The Virtual Economy Manager is a new section in the GROW Dashboard in which you can review, manage and deploy your games' virtual economy. In this section you can actually update your virtual economy without having to release an update to the market (App Store/Google Play).

To get started you'll first need to configure a hard coded economy in your game. Once the device syncs with the GROW network, refresh the economy screen and you'll see your economy in the Dashboard. From now on any change you make to the economy from within the Dashboard will be synced to your game - you can create and delete your economy's categories and currencies in addition to creating new virtual items and currency packs.


## Managing your virtual items
There are five kinds of virtual items you can create, click the virtual good button in order to create a new one:

### Made changes but changed your mind?
In order to discard *any* changes after you've already deployed a new economy - simply click on the Delete Economy button. The economy will be synced back to the hard coded economy the next time someone will load your game on his device.
