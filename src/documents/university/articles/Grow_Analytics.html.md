# Dashboard - Analytics

## Get to know your players

The [Analytics Dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la/) provides you with useful information about your game. It allows you to investigate your games' performance, analyze revenue, [retention](/university/articles/Grow_Retention) and a lot more.

### DASHBOARD

In the main Dashboard screen you can get general information about the activity in your game as well as information about the operations of the different GROW services you integrated. The general game information includes the number of Active Users your game has, you can also see the number of Paying Users, New Users, Revenue, number of Purchases and even what your users purchase the most.

This is sort of a high-level insight to your data and you can drill down by looking at the other sections such as Activity and Money.

> Financial information like `Payers`, `Revenue ` and `Top Product` require that you integrate [Store](http://know.soom.la/unity/store/) in your game.

Below the general information section, you'll see some widgets that describe the different services provided by GROW. [Whales Report](/university/articles/Grow_WhalesReport) and Insights widgets will provide you with relevant high-level information about those services. Other widgets show you data about the Sync - how many users play on more than one device and Fraud - how many players and orders were identified as fraud and blocked.

> The [Whales Report](/university/articles/Grow_WhalesReport) and Insights widgets require that you have any one of our [Grow Bundles](http://dashboard.soom.la/games//quickStart) installed in your game.

> [State Economy & Sync](http://know.soom.la/unity/grow/grow_sync/) requires one of the following bundles: Grow Spend or Grow Ultimate.

> [Fraud Protection](/university/articles/Grow_FraudProtection) requires Grow Ultimate.

### ACTIVITY

In the Activity screen you can get information about your active users and their sessions.

For example, if you’ve just uploaded a new feature to your game you can use the Activity screen to see if this feature keeps your users in the game for a longer period of time (Avg. Session Duration) and if your DAU has increased - if the answer is yes to both - this means this feature is working and you did something right!

The widgets you can see on the Activity screen are:

*Conversion* - you get a quick view of the number of new users you have and how many you’ve managed to convert > how many users rated your game and how many users connected to a social network within your game, you get all this also with breakdown to the device types!
> will only show up if you have [Profile](http://know.soom.la/unity/profile/) installed

*Conversion by Country* - you get to see your users spread out on a map with additional indication of how many raters and how many connected to a social platform

### MONEY

In the Money screen you can analyze your game revenue and your paying users. You can see see how many payers you actually have and specifically how many new / returning payers.

Some of the metrics you can see are your Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and you can also see the Avg. Time to Payment which is very interesting info about your payers.

There are two widgets in the Money section: *Conversion* and *Conversion by Country* that are the same as in the Activity screen, in addition to those there's the *Items* widget where you can see a list of the items your game offers with the number of purchases and revenue per item (this widget requires that you have [Store](http://know.soom.la/unity/store/) installed in your game).
