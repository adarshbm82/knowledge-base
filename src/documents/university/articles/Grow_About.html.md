# About GROW

## GROW - Data is for everyone!

GROW is a new and innovative data network. You can use Grow to gain valuable insights about your users  and enrich your in-game experience through an amazing set of backend services that completes the client side open-source framework into a perfect solution every F2P game needs.  At the end, GROW provides you with tools to increase monetization and engagement of VIP users and easily get your in-game experience to a next level.

GROW uses all of SOOMLA's modules: [Store](/unity/store/), [Profile](/unity/profile/) and [LevelUp](/unity/levelup/) to collect in-game data and render value for you. Studios may choose to use only specific modules, however, to benefit from the full power of GROW analytics we recommend that you integrate all three.

To get started with GROW, you can follow each one of different GROW bundles' tutorials:

- [GrowUltimate](/unity/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted)

- [GrowCompete](/unity/grow/GrowCompete_GettingStarted)

- [GrowViral](/unity/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted)

- [GrowSpend](/unity/grow/GrowSpend_GettingStarted)

- [GrowInsights](/unity/grow/GrowInsights_GettingStarted)


### Why use GROW?
- GROW's Insights module brings you powerful information about your users in real-time. This information ranges from the user’s purchasing habits to his social behavior in the same game genre or in all other genres. You can use these insights to take actions on your users during gameplay, when it really matters. Some of the actions you can take are:

  - Create special prices / discounted bundles for paying users in your genre
  
  - Adapt the game difficulty for specific users
  
  - Display ads for non-payers only
  
  - Create push campaigns
  
  - Identify the time of the day the player is likely to purchase and send him offers accordingly
  

- If you use SOOMLA Store and you join GROW, you’ll receive a weekly [Whales Report](/university/articles/Grow_WhalesReport/) to your inbox, this report identifies the paying players in your game from the grow data network and tells you how many payers from other games you’ve managed to convert and how much money you left on the table

- The [Analytics dashboard](/university/articles/Grow_Analytics/) will provide you with free useful information about your game when you join the GROW network. In the dashboard, you'll be able to see aggregative analytics about your games and investigate its performance, analyze revenue, retention and a lot more

- SOOMLA has created some Backend Services that will put your game on steroids and by that increases user experience and engagement:

  - Social Leaderboards lets your players compete with their friends.
  
  - Gifting lets your players help their friends by sending them coins, lives and upgrades.
  
  - Sync lets your players pick up where they left off regardless of the device they’re using.
  
  - Economy Management lets you make changes to your virtual economy at real time. Every change you'll do will automatically be sent to all devices playing your game.
  
  - Fraud Protection lets you secure your in-app purchases by marking and blocking fraud suspects, receipt validation and identifying abnormal purchase behavior. This feature takes the receipt validation from the SOOMLA Store module and adds a sophisticated layer for advanced verification.

  GROW is free for studios who join and share their in-game data in it. The main goal is to help mobile game studios create better, more engaging games, that anyone can enjoy.
