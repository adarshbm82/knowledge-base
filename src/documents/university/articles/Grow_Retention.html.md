# Dashboard - Rentention

## How often do your players return and engage with your game?

If your users find your game valuable, they'll keep coming back. The Retention reports show you how often your users come back and play your game. You can use the data in the Retention reports to track and measure if the changes you make to your game increase your user's retention and make changes to your game accordingly, to prevent churn.

We have three types of Retention reports, each report gives you a different perspective on your user's behavior:

### Regular Retention
In this report you can see how many *new users* / *first time users* played your game, you see the date in which they started playing and you can also see how many of them came back to play N days after they first came.

The two leftmost columns represent how many users started playing your game and the specific day they came in. Any other column “i” represents how many users visited your game in the i-th day after the starting day.

### Rolling Retention
Rolling Retention shows you of all the users who came to your game once over a specific period of time, how many are still around N days later. It's crucial to understand how quickly users stop coming back to your game in order to assess the validity of the game.

The report displays the percentage or actual number of users still active N days after they first installed and played your game, regardless of whether they came back *each and every day*.

Like in the Regular Retention, in Rolling the two leftmost columns show the number of users who start to play on those days. Every other column “i" represents the number of users who visited your game after “i” days **or more** according to the date range you’re looking at.

### Return Retention
This retention is different than the previous two since it shows which proportion of the users come back to the game at least once within N days.
It accounts for all active users on a certain date and shows you their return rate from that day on. This report lets you identify weaker and stronger days of gameplay over time.

The leftmost column represents the total number of users which visited your game on the exact day, while the other columns tell you how many of them came after the i-th day.

Retention is a **very** important metric for F2P games. It's a direct factor in the computation of the LTV of the players. It also expresses how much *(or little)* players like your game and if it's entertaining enough for them to keep coming back for more.
