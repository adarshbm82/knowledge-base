# Integrations

## Integrations for everyone

We wanted to get you riding the GROW network smoothly so we’ve packed some nice integrations for you. These integrations allow you to receive analytics from your existing SDKs.

Why integrate GROW? because it’s *Simple* , *Accurate* and *Smart*. It's much *simpler* to connect your already existing SDKs to GROW than to set up each event separately. GROW includes excellent Fraud Protection which results in more *accurate* Revenue metrics. GROW Analytics is simply a *smart*, lightweight dashboard which is designed according to what people really need.

Integrating GROW gives you more than just Analytics, you also get God Mode Analytics which lets you see metrics of other games and specifically other games that your users are playing.

GROW can help you understand what your users like. For example, you can change your game accordingly to get your players more engaged and you can also see what’s hot out there to decide what your next game will be and what it should include (genre, theme, art style and more..).


## Available Integrations

You can find GROW integrations for multiple kinds of SDKs. From IAP to Ad Networks and Social SDKs, we’ve got you covered.


All integrations can be found in the integrations page in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.soom.la)

## What does an integration include?

All integrations include the *Highway* agent which is responsible for sending events to the GROW servers and dashboard. Highway also sends session events so that your Daily/Monthly Active Users, Sessions, Average Session Duration and other metrics can be calculated and displayed in the dashboard.
