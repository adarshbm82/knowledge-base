# GrowSoomla - Bundle

## Overview

GrowSoomla is the perfect solution for your game if you have already integrated any of the SOOMLA open-source modules into it. If you just want to get Analytics Whales Report and Grow Insights then this bundle is for you. GrowSoomla connects you to GROW, SOOMLA's flagship - a community-driven data network. Mobile game studios can take advantage of the different GROW products in order to get valuable insights about their games' performance and increase retention and monetization.

GrowSoomla includes:

- [Analytics](/university/articles/Grow_Analytics)

- [Whales Report](/university/articles/Grow_WhalesReport)

- [Insights](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/Grow_Insights)

## Integrating GrowSoomla

### New Game & Configurations

Go to the [GROW dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la) and sign up \ login. Upon logging in, you will be directed to the main page of the dashboard. You will need to create a new game in order to start your journey with GROW.

<div class="info-box">If you didn't already, clone the Cocos2d-x framework from [here](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x), or download it from the [Cocos2d-x website](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download). Make sure the version you clone is supported by SOOMLA's modules (the tag is the version).</div>

1. In the games screen click on the "+" button to add a new game. If it's your first time in the dashboard, just click on the "+" button underneath the "Create your first game" label in the middle of the screen.

	  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/cocos_grow/addNewApp.png "Add new app")

	Once you created your game, you'll be redirected to a quick start process to download any of the GROW bundles (You can also click "Downloads" on the top right corner of the screen). Click on **GrowSoomla**. You'll see an instructions screen, you can continue with that or stay here for the extended version.  

2. Unzip the downloaded file and copy its contents into the cocos2d directory located at the root of your Cocos2d-x project.


### Initialize modules

<div class="info-box">Make sure to initialize each module ONLY ONCE when your application loads.</div>
<br>
<div class="info-box">The CCGrowHighway module is the module responsible for connecting your game to the GROW network. In order for it to operate it only needs to be initialized.</div>

1. In your `AppDelegate.cpp` include `Cocos2dxHighway.h`:

  ```cpp
  #include "Cocos2dxHighway.h"
  ```

2. Make sure that you initialize `CCSoomla` with a custom secret of your choice (**Custom Secret** is an encryption secret you provide that will be used to secure your data.):

  ```cpp
  soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("ExampleCustomSecret");
  ```

  <div class="warning-box">Choose this secret wisely, you can't change it after you launch your game!</div>

3. Initialize `CCGrowHighway` with the "Game Key" and "Env Key" given to you in the [dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la):

  **Copy the "Game Key" and "Environment Key"** given to you from the [dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la) and initialize `CCGrowHighway` with them. At this point, you're probably testing your integration and you want to use the **Sandbox** environment key.

  Explanation: The "game" and "env" keys allow for your game to distinguish multiple environments for the same game. The dashboard pre-generates two fixed environments for your game: **Production** and **Sandbox**. When you decide to publish your game, make sure to switch the env key to **Production**.  You can always generate more environments.  For example - you can choose to have a playground environment for your game's beta testers which will be isolated from your production environment and will thus prevent analytics data from being mixed between the two.  Another best practice is to have a separate environment for each version of your game.

  ```
  // Make sure to make this call in your AppDelegate's
  // applicationDidFinishLaunching method, and before
  // initializing any other SOOMLA/GROW components
  // i.e. before CCSoomlaStore::initialize(...)
  grow::CCGrowHighway::initShared(
      __String::create("yourGameKey"),
      __String::create("yourEnvKey"));
  ```

  <img src="/img/tutorial_img/cocos_grow/dashboardKeys.png" alt="Game key and Env key" style="border:0;">

4. Initialize Insights:

  	``` cpp
  // Make sure to make this call AFTER initializing HIGHWAY
    grow::CCGrowInsights::initShared();
  	```

5. Make sure that in your current implementation you initialize the open-source modules (Store/Profile) **AFTER** the initialization of Highway.

### **Instructions for iOS**

In your XCode project, perform the following steps:

1. Add `jansson` (**external/jansson/**) to your project (just add it as a source folder, make sure to check "create group").

2. For each of the following XCode projects:

  - `Cocos2dXHighway.xcodeproj` (**extensions/cocos2dx-highway/**)

  perform the following:

  - Drag the project into your project

  - Add its targets to your **Build Phases->Target Dependencies**

  - Add the Products (\*.a) of the project to **Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries**.

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/cocos_grow/iosStep2.png "iOS Integration")

3. Add the following directories to **Build Settings->Header Search Paths** (with the `recursive` option):

  NOTE: This article assumes you have a `cocos2d` folder under your project folder which either contains the Cocos2d-x framework, or links to to its root folder.

 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-highway/Soomla`

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/cocos_grow/headerSP.png "Header search paths")

4. Make sure that you have the `-ObjC` to the **Build Setting->Other Linker Flags**

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/ios_getting_started/linkerFlags.png "Linker Flags")

5. Make sure you have these 10 Frameworks linked to your XCode project:

  - Security

  - libsqlite3.0.dylib
  
  - libz.dylib

  - StoreKit

  - CFNetwork

  - libicucore

  - SystemConfiguration

  - MediaPlayer

  - GameController

That's it! Now all you have to do is build your XCode project and run your game.

### **Instructions for Android**

1. Import cocos2dx-highway module into your project's Android.mk by adding the following:

    ```
    LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += cocos2dx_highway_static
    # add these line along with your other LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES

    $(call import-module, extensions/cocos2dx-highway)
    # add these line at the end of the file, along with the other import-module calls
    ```

2. Add the following jars to your android project's classpath (or into its libs dir):

  From `extensions/cocos2dx-highway/build/android`

    - AndroidViper.jar

    - Cocos2dxAndroidHighway.jar

    - google-play-services.jar

3. Update your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

  ``` xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  
  ```

That's it! Don't forget to run the **build_native.py** script so that SOOMLA sources will be built with cocos2d-x.

## Module usage & event handling

The next step is to create your game specific implementation for each of the modules. Use SOOMLA's awesome products to create better in-game economy, social interactions, game design and user experience.  
In order to be notified about (and handle) SOOMLA-related events, you will also need to create event-handling functions. Refer to the following sections for more information:



 - **Insights** - Getting in-game information about your users in real-time used to be a dream. Now it's here. Insights will tell you things about your users (as seen in other games) inside the code so you can take actions when it matters. This is the power of the GROW data network.  
[API](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/Grow_Insights#MainClasses&Methods) | [Events](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/Grow_Insights#Events)



## Example

Below is a short example of how to initialize SOOMLA's modules. We suggest you read about the different modules and their entities in SOOMLA's Knowledge Base:  [Insights](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/Grow_Insights).

### Initialization

```cpp
using namespace grow;

bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching() {

    // Add event listeners - Make sure to set the event handlers before you initialize
	Director::getInstance()->getEventDispatcher()->addCustomEventListener(
	            CCHighwayConsts::EVENT_GROW_INSIGHTS_INITIALIZED, CC_CALLBACK_1(Example::onGrowInsightsInitialized, this));
	Director::getInstance()->getEventDispatcher()->addCustomEventListener(
	            CCHighwayConsts::EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED, CC_CALLBACK_1(Example::onInsightsRefreshFinished, this));

	soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("ExampleCustomSecret");

	// Initialize GrowHighway
	CCGrowHighway::initShared(
	     __String::create("yourGameKey"),
	     __String::create("yourEnvKey"));

	// Initialize GrowInsights
	CCGrowInsights::initShared();
}

void ExampleScene::onGrowInsightsInitialized(cocos2d::CCDictionary *eventData) {
    cocos2d::log("GROW insights has been initialized.");
}

void ExampleScene::onInsightsRefreshFinished(cocos2d::CCDictionary *eventData) {
    if (CCGrowInsights::getInstance()->getUserInsights()->
                getPayInsights()->getPayRankForGenre(Genre::Educational) > 3) {
        // ... Do stuff according to your business plan ...
    }
}
```
