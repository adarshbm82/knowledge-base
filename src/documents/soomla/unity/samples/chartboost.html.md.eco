# Chartboost Integration


Showing interstital ads is easy. Choosing which users to show them to, and at what frequency is the hard part.  This code sample shows how to increase / decrease ad exposure according to user purchase history.  For this example we consider four types of users:

* non-payers -  haven't paid in other games

* Minnows -  paid up to $1 in other games

* Dolphins -  paid up to $5 in other games

* Whales -  paid more than $5 in other games

<div class="samples-title">Getting started</div>

1. Sign up to <a href="https://www.chartboost.com/" target="_blank">Chartboost</a>.

2. Add your app to the Chartboost dashboard and download the latest SDK. See <a href="https://answers.chartboost.com/hc/en-us/categories/200356615-SDKs-and-Integrations">Unity instructions</a>.

3. Integrate the SOOMLA <a href="/unity/grow/growultimate_gettingstarted/" target="_blank">GrowUltimate bundle</a>.

4. Load user pay insights by handling the Grow event `OnInsightsRefreshFinished` and caching the `PayRankByGenre`.

5. When level gameplay ends in your game, handle the LevelUp event `OnLevelEnded`.  Then determine according to the pay insights how often to show an interstitial ad.  The more a user is likely to pay, the less you want to show him interstitials to reduce the barriers to first purchase.
