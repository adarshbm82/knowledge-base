# IStoreAssets

## What is IStoreAssets?

`IStoreAssets` is an interface that represents a single game’s economy. When you use SOOMLA to create your game economy, one of the first steps to take is to create your own implementation of `IStoreAssets`. This is where you declare all of your virtual currencies, virtual currency packs, and virtual goods of all kinds.

<div class="info-box">Each item in `IStoreAssets` has a unique item ID that is used to identify it in various functions throughout the SDK. Make sure your item IDs do NOT contain periods (.).</div>

### Example

This is a brief example of `IStoreAssets`, our [MuffinRush Example](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidStoreTest/src/com/soomla/test/MuffinRushAssets.java) contains a more detailed implementation. In the [Functions section](#functions) below, you'll find explanations of the functions in `IStoreAssets`.

``` java
public class ExampleAssets implements IStoreAssets{

  ...

  @Override
  public int getVersion () {
    return 0;
  }

  // NOTE: Even if you have no use in one of these functions, you still need to
  // implement them all and just return an empty array.

  @Override
  public VirtualCurrency[] getCurrencies () {
    return new VirtualCurrency[] { COIN_CURRENCY };
  }

  @Override
  public VirtualGood[] getGoods () {
    return new VirtualGood[] { SHIELD_GOOD, NO_ADS_LTVG };
  }

  @Override
  public VirtualCurrencyPack[] getCurrencyPacks () {
    return new VirtualCurrencyPack[] { HUND_COIN_PACK };
  }

  @Override
  public VirtualCategory[] getCategories () {
    return new VirtualCategory[] { GENERAL_CATEGORY };
  }

  /** Virtual Currencies **/

  public static final VirtualCurrency COIN_CURRENCY = new VirtualCurrency(
    "Coin",                               // Name
    "Coin currency",                      // Description
    "coin_currency_ID"                    // Item ID
  );

  /** Virtual Currency Packs **/

  public static final VirtualCurrencyPack HUND_COIN_PACK = new VirtualCurrencyPack(
    "100 Coins",                          // Name
    "100 coin currency units",            // Description
    "coins_100_ID",                       // Item ID
    100,                                  // Number of currencies in the pack
    "coin_currency_ID",                   // ID of the currency associated with this pack
    new PurchaseWithMarket(               // Purchase type (with real money $$$)
      "coins_100_PROD_ID",                   // Product ID
      1.99                                   // Price (in real money $$$)
    )
  );

  /** Virtual Goods **/

  public static final VirtualGood SHIELD_GOOD = new SingleUseVG(
    "Shield",                             // Name
    "Protect yourself from enemies",      // Description
    "shield_ID",                          // Item ID
    new PurchaseWithVirtualItem(          // Purchase type (with virtual currency)
      "coin_currency_ID",                    // ID of the item used to pay with
      225                                    // Price (amount of coins)
    )
  );

  // NOTE: Create non-consumable items using LifeTimeVG with PurchaseType of PurchaseWithMarket.
  public static final VirtualGood NO_ADS_LTVG = new LifetimeVG(
    "No Ads",                             // Name
    "No More Ads!",                       // Description
    "no_ads_ID",                          // Item ID
    new PurchaseWithMarket(               // Purchase type
      new MarketItem(                        // (with real money $$$)
        "no_ads_PROD_ID",                      // Product ID
        MarketItem.Managed.MANAGED,            // Managed by the market
        0.99                                   // Price (in real money $$$)
      )
    )
  );

  /** Virtual Categories **/

  public static VirtualCategory GENERAL_CATEGORY = new VirtualCategory (
    "GENERAL", new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(SHIELD_GOOD))
  );

```

After you’ve implemented your version of `IStoreAssets`, you’ll need to initialize `SoomlaStore` with the implementation you just created (also explained in the [Getting Started](/android/store/Store_GettingStarted) tutorial).

``` cs
SoomlaStore.getInstance().initialize(new ExampleAssets());
```

`IStoreAssets` is transformed into metadata in JSON format and saved in a local SQLite database on the device. After that, the economy is always loaded from the database. More about this in [Storage](/android/store/Store_Storage).

## Functions

### `getVersion`

This value will determine if the saved data in the database will be deleted or not. Bump the version every time you want to delete the old data in the DB. If you don't bump this value, you won't be able to see changes you've made to the objects in your implementation of `IStoreAssets`.

For example: If you previously created a `VirtualGood` with the name "Hat" and you published your application, the name "Hat” will be saved in all of your users' databases. If you want to change the name to "Green_hat" then you'll also have to bump the version (increase the number that the `getVersion` function returns). Now the new "Green_hat" name will replace the old one.

### `getCurrencies`

Create an instance of all your desired virtual currencies. For every `VirtualCurrency`, you'll have to provide: name, description and item ID. Use this functions to access your game's currencies.

### `getCurrencyPacks`

Create an instance of all your desired `VirtualCurrencyPack`s. For every `VirtualCurrencyPack`, you'll have to provide: name, description, item ID, purchase type, currency amount (the amount of currencies in the pack), and currency item ID (the item ID of the associated currency). Use this functions to access your game's currency packs.

### `getGoods`

Create an instance of all your desired `VirtualGood`s. For every good, you'll have to provide: name, description, item ID and purchase type. Use this function to access your game's virtual goods.

### `getCategories`

Create an instance of all your desired virtual categories. For every `VirtualCategory`, you'll have to provide: name and goods item IDs (list of item IDs of the `VirtualGood`s in this category). Use this function to access your game's categories.

<div class="info-box">If you don't want to categorize your `VirtualGood`s, just add one 'GENERAL' `VirtualCategory`.</div>
