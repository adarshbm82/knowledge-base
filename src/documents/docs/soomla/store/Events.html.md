# **Event Handling**

SOOMLA uses a [publish-subscribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) pattern for event handling. In order to be notified of store-related events, you can register for events, get notifications on various events, and create your game-specific behavior to handle them, as an addition to the behavior already defined by SOOMLA.

## Android

android-store supplies a package of Events, which contains many classes that represent  store-related events. Some of these are `MarketPurchaseEvent`, `MarketRefundEvent`, `CurrencyBalanceChangeEvent`, and many more. You can see the full list of events [here](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/tree/master/SoomlaAndroidStore/src/com/soomla/store/events).

In addition, android-store provides a singleton class called `BusProvider`, which exposes functions `post`, `register`, and `unregister`. Internally, `BusProvider` uses Square’s open-source project [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/). Use the singleton instance of `BusProvider` to obtain the bus. Use the functions provided to publish-subscribe and handle the various events:

- `post` - Use to post (publish) a new event, which essentially informs subscribers that an action has occurred.

- `register` - In order to receive events, a class needs to register with the `BusProvider`.

- `unregister` - In order to stop receiving events, a class needs to unregister with the `BusProvider`.

## iOS

iOS-store uses Apple Developer’s NSNotificationCenter to handle events across the SDK. iOS-store contains classes `EventHandling.h` and `EventHandling.m`.
