# Event Handling

## About

LevelUp allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

## Triggering Events

In LevelUp, events are fired from various functions throughout the code. Read below to learn how to listen for and handle the various events.

## Observing & Handling Events

Each platform-specific LevelUp module has its own, slightly different, event-handling mechanism, but in any platform you'll need to sign up to be notified of events. Then, once notified, you'll need to handle the different events with your game-specific behavior.

Some of the functions that you'll need to implement in order to handle events are:

- `onGateOpened`

- `onScoreRecordChanged`

- `onWorldCompleted`

- `onGateOpened`

and several others.

### In cocos2dx-levelup

In cocos2dx-levelup, to be notified of events and handle them, you need to create an event handler class that implements `CCLevelUpEventHandler`. Then, to "sign up for" (be notified about) events, add your class to the `CCLevelUpEventDispatcher`.

``` cpp
// Say you called your event handler class "myLevelUpEventHandler"
soomla::CCLevelUpEventDispatcher::getInstance()->addEventHandler(myLevelUpEventHandler);
```

### In unity3d-levelup

The `LevelUpEvents` class is where all events go through. To listen for and handle various events, just add your game-specific behavior to the delegates in the `LevelUpEvents` class.

``` cs
LevelUpEvents.OnWorldCompleted += onWorldCompleted;
```
